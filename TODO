Needed to replace NGINX for my personal sites:
- Upstream retry settings.
- Upstream failover settings.
- Gracefully handle downstream errors
- Separate out access.log and error.log

Needed to replace ELBs in-front of ECS services:
- ECS upstream provider, ideas:
    - Use SDK to query for matching containers (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeContainerInstances.html)

Nice to haves:
- Allow configs to set timeouts, port, etc.
- Consider using DNS for all types of upstreams, instead of decoupling.
- Plug-in customizable Transport
- Allow response transformations.
- Add leastconn upsteam selection option
- Healthcheck on single upstream
- Extend Bind / RequestMatcher, to allow binding based on headers and other features.
