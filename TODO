Needed to replace NGINX for my personal sites:
- Upstream retry settings.
- Upstream failover settings.
- Gracefully handle downstream errors
- Separate out access.log and error.log

Needed to replace ELBs in-front of ECS services:
- ECS upstream provider, use AWS SDK
    - Find tasks: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html
    - Look up hosts: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeContainerInstances.html
    - Get IP of host: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-DescribeInstances.html
    - How to minimize downtime due to changes? Update on error?

Nice to haves:
- Allow configs to set timeouts, port, etc.
- Consider using DNS for all types of upstreams, instead of decoupling.
- Plug-in customizable Transport
- Allow response transformations.
- Add leastconn upsteam selection option
- Healthcheck on single upstream
- Extend Bind / RequestMatcher, to allow binding based on headers and other features.
