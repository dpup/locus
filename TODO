Needed to replace ELBs in-front of ECS services:
- ECS upstream provider, use AWS SDK
    - Find tasks: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html
    - Look up hosts: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeContainerInstances.html
    - Get IP of host: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-DescribeInstances.html
    - How to minimize downtime due to changes? Update on error?

Nice to haves:
- Healthcheck on upstreams
- Debug page shows connections, failures, etc.
- Extend Bind / Matcher, to allow binding based on headers and other features
- Consider using DNS for all types of upstreams, instead of decoupling.
- Allow response transformations.
- For locus_host, consider rewriting URLs or setting a cookie so pages actually function.
- Add leastconn upsteam selection option
- Convenience for multiple host aliases.
- Nice error pages from Go standard libs:
    - URI length
    - Header length
    - Timeouts
    - see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15034
- Plug-in customizable Transport in reverseProxy
